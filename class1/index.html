# Technical principles without political depth
&gt;"It may be true in some sense that a regime becomes more open whenever it provides additional open data, even for mun- dane and apolitical topics, but **it is easy to imagine that a closed regime might disclose large amounts of data conforming to these eight requirements without in any way advancing its actual accountability as a government**. 

&gt; [‚Ä¶] An electronic release of the propaganda statements made by North Korea‚Äôs political leadership, for example, might satisfy all eight of these requirements and might not tend to promote any additional transparency or accountability on the part of the notoriously closed and unaccountable regime."

#IN THEORY

All raw public data are open as soon as they're produced.

#IN PRACTICE

Civil servants choose which data they will open, when, how and what they will hold.

# Limits of supply-side open data for government administrations
.pull-left[

- A considerable but underestimated work

- "No one's job": it's extremely rare to have dedicatd agents in local authorities for open data projects. 

- Projects which depend on political support

- Data publics are often untraceable.

.pull-right[
- Data are hard to find: portals are labyrinths

- Open data initiatives are [still rare](https://opendatainception.io/)

- Granular and longitudinal data are still scarce.

# Crowdsourcing: an alternative way of getting data
.pull-left[![](img/crowd.png)
]
.pull-right[
&gt;‚ÄúSimply defined, crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call. This can take the form of peer-production (when the job is performed collaboratively), but is also often undertaken by sole individuals.‚Äù
