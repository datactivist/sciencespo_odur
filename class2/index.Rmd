> We got our hands in the data, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the data we need. We have to check out if details are valid, such as the meta-data, the methodology of collection, if we know who organised the dataset and it‚Äôs a credible source. We‚Äôve heard a joke once, but it‚Äôs only funny because it‚Äôs true: **all data is bad, we just need to find out how bad it is**!

# ODB: the issue of government data quality 
.pull-left[
>**Government data is usually incomplete, out of date, of low quality, and fragmented.** In most cases, open data catalogues or portals are manually fed as the result of informal data management approaches. **Procedures, timelines, and responsibilities are frequently unclear among government institutions tasked with this work.**

#GODI: the issue of data findability
.pull-left[
> Data findability is a major challenge. We have data portals and registries, but government agencies under one national government still publish data in different ways and different locations. Moreover, they have different protocols for license and formats(‚Ä¶)
**Data findability is a prerequisite for open data to fulfill its potential and currently most data is very hard to find.**

# FING: data quality sprint üèÉ

**Why ?**
Non-quality of data has a high cost. It is notorious that 80% of a data scientist workload consists of data wrangling. Lots of high potential datasets are merely unusable. 

**For whom?**
All the actors in the data pipeline:
- collectors: have an overview of issues and launch initiatives to improve quality
- producers: gain feedback on data quality, improve data before publication
- project owners: anticipate issues reusers will encounter
- reusers: check the quality before starting a data project

**How?**
A "stress-test for data with a checklist and a template for reporting issues.

# A collaborative translation

The quality sprint is only in English, we will translate it collaboratively and release the result. 

**How?** 
- I created a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sWX8tYmE_4JnLTiNAaxsvNFbR4WO0XZXJ37RQW3cjeQ/edit#gid=678479114) copy of the original document.

- Each of you will translate 10 lines **in the report** (tab "rapport qualit√©") before next class

- Assign yourselves in Basecamp
